## Rules for a great git commit message style
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Wrap lines at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what and why you have done something.
